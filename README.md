# Welcome to PySpy

PySpy is a personal project I am developing in real time to showcase my ability to follow the SDLC cycle, industry best practices,
merge my understanding of IOT to real projects, and practice AWS integrations.

Below is a rough draft I put together of a High level Solution of this project. Updates will be made rather regularly to documentation
as I learn more about the proper way to develop my first complete AWS integrated project independently.
